\section*{Kaprekar numbers}

A positive integer is a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar\_number}{Kaprekar number}
if:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It is 1
\item
  The decimal representation of its square may be split once into two
  parts consisting of positive integers which sum to the original
  number. Note that a split resulting in a part consisting purely of 0s
  is not valid, as 0 is not considered positive.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Example Kaprekar numbers]
\end{description}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  2223 is a Kaprekar number, as 2223 * 2223 = 4941729, 4941729 may be
  split to 494 and 1729, and 494 + 1729 = 2223.
\item
  The series of Kaprekar numbers is known as
  \href{http://oeis.org/A006886}{A006886}, and begins as
  1,9,45,55,\ldots{}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Example process]
\end{description}

10000 (100\textsuperscript{2}) splitting from left to right:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The first split is {[}1, 0000{]}, and is invalid; the 0000 element
  consists entirely of 0s, and 0 is not considered positive.
\item
  Slight optimization opportunity: When splitting from left to right,
  once the right part consists entirely of 0s, no further testing is
  needed; all further splits would also be invalid.
\end{itemize}

Generate and show all Kaprekar numbers less than 10,000.

Optionally, count (and report the count of) how many Kaprekar numbers
are less than 1,000,000.

\begin{description}
\item[Extra extra credit]
\end{description}

The concept of Kaprekar numbers is not limited to base 10 (i.e. decimal
numbers); if you can, show that Kaprekar numbers exist in other bases
too. For this purpose, do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Find all Kaprekar numbers for base 17 between 1 and 1,000,000 (one
  million);
\item
  Display each of them in base 10 representation;
\item
  Optionally, using base 17 representation (use letters `a' to `g' for
  digits 10(10) to 16(10)), display each of the numbers, its square, and
  where to split the square. For example, 225(10) is ``d4'' in base 17,
  its square ``a52g'', and a5(17) + 2g(17) = d4(17), so the display
  would be something like:

\begin{verbatim}
225   d4  a52g  a5 + 2g
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Keyboard macros}

Show how to link user defined methods to user defined keys. An example
of this is the facility provided by emacs for
\href{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html\_node/emacs/Key-Bindings.html}{key
bindings}. These key bindings may be application-specific or
system-wide; state which you have done.

\begin{wideverbatim}

The 'fkey' function associates a key with an executable body. Some common key
codes are predefined in "lib/term.l". Here we use 'F1' to store the value 1 in
a global variable, 'Up' and 'Down' arrows to increment or decrement that value,
and 'Home' to print the current value to the console.

(load "@lib/term.l")

(fkey *XtF1
   (prinl "Initialized value to " (setq *Number 1)) )

(fkey *XtUp
   (prinl "Incremented to " (inc '*Number)) )

(fkey *XtDown
   (prinl "Decremented to " (dec '*Number)) )

(fkey *XtHome
   (prinl "Current value is " *Number) )

Output when hitting 'F1', 'Down', 'Up', 'Up' and 'Home':

Initialized value to 1
Decremented to 0
Incremented to 1
Incremented to 2
Current value is 2

\section*{Knapsack problem/0-1}

A tourist wants to make a good trip at the weekend with his friends.
They will go to the mountains to see the wonders of nature, so he needs
to pack well for the trip. He has a good knapsack for carrying things,
but knows that he can carry a maximum of only 4kg in it and it will have
to last the whole day. He creates a list of what he wants to bring for
the trip but the total weight of all items is too much. He then decides
to add columns to his initial list detailing their weights and a
numerical value representing how important the item is for the trip.

The tourist can choose to take any combination of items from the list,
but only one of each item is available. He may not cut or diminish the
items, so he can only take whole units of any item.

\textbf{Which items does the tourist carry in his knapsack so that their
total weight does not exceed 400 dag {[}4 kg{]}, and their total value
is maximised?} 

Here is the list:

\section*{Knapsack problem/Bounded}

A tourist wants to make a good trip at the weekend with his friends.
They will go to the mountains to see the wonders of nature. So he needs
some items during the trip. Food, clothing, etc. He has a good knapsack
for carrying the things, but he knows that he can carry only 4 kg weight
in his knapsack, because they will make the trip from morning to
evening. He creates a list of what he wants to bring for the trip, but
the total weight of all items is too much. He adds a value to each item.
The value represents how important the thing for the tourist. The list
contains which items are the wanted things for the trip, what is the
weight and value of an item, and how many units does he have from each
items.

The tourist can choose to take any combination of items from the list,
and some number of each item is available (see the column ``Piece(s)''
of the list!). He may not cut the items, so he can only take whole units
of any item.

\textbf{Which items does the tourist carry in his knapsack so that their
total weight does not exceed 4 kg, and their total value is maximised?}

\section*{Knapsack problem/Continuous}

A robber burgles a butcher's shop, where he can select from some items.
He knows the weights and prices of each items. Because he has a knapsack
with 15 kg maximal capacity, he wants to select the items such that he
would have his profit maximized. He may cut the items; the item has a
reduced price after cutting that is proportional to the original price
by the ratio of masses. That means: half of an item has half the price
of the original.

This is the item list in the butcher's:

\section*{Knapsack problem/Unbounded}

A traveller gets diverted and has to make an unscheduled stop in what
turns out to be Shangri La. Opting to leave, he is allowed to take as
much as he likes of the following items, so long as it will fit in his
knapsack, and he can carry it. He knows that he can carry no more than
25 `weights' in total; and that the capacity of his knapsack is 0.25
`cubic lengths'.

Looking just above the bar codes on the items he finds their weights and
volumes. He digs out his recent copy of a financial paper and gets the
value of each item.

He can only take whole units of any item, but there is much more of any
item than he could ever carry

\textbf{How many of each item does he take to maximise the value of
items he is carrying away with him?}

Note:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  There are four solutions that maximise the value taken. Only one
  \emph{need} be given.

\section*{Knight's tour}

\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight\%27s\_tour}{Problem}: you have
a standard 8x8 chessboard, empty but for a single knight on some square.
Your task is to emit a series of legal knight moves that result in the
knight visiting every square on the chessboard exactly once. Note that
it is \emph{not} a requirement that the tour be ``closed''; that is, the
knight need not end within a single move of its start position.

Input and output may be textual or graphical, according to the
conventions of the programming environment. If textual, squares should
be indicated in
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic\_chess\_notation}{algebraic
notation}. The output should indicate the order in which the knight
visits the squares, starting with the initial position. The form of the
output may be a diagram of the board with the squares numbered ordering
to visitation sequence, or a textual list of algebraic coordinates in
order, or even an actual animation of the knight moving around the
chessboard.

Input: starting square

Output: move sequence

\section*{Knuth's algorithm S}

This is a method of randomly sampling n items from a set of M items,
with equal probability; where M \textgreater{}= n and M, the number of
items is unknown until the end. This means that the equal probability
sampling should be maintained for all successive items \textgreater{} n
as they become available (although the content of successive samples can
change).

\begin{description}
\item[The algorithm]
\end{description}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Select the first n items as the sample as they become available;
\item
  For the i-th item where i \textgreater{} n, have a random chance of
  n/i of keeping it. If failing this chance, the sample remains the
  same. If not, have it randomly (1/n) replace one of the previously
  selected n items of the sample.
\item
  Repeat \#2 for any subsequent items.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{description}
\item[The Task]
\end{description}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Create a function \texttt{s\_of\_n\_creator} that given \emph{n} the
  maximum sample size, returns a function \texttt{s\_of\_n} that takes
  one parameter, \texttt{item}.
\item
  Function \texttt{s\_of\_n} when called with successive items returns
  an equi-weighted random sample of up to n of its items so far, each
  time it is called, calculated using Knuths Algorithm S.
\item
  Test your functions by printing and showing the frequency of
  occurrences of the selected digits from 100,000 repetitions of:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Use the s\_of\_n\_creator with n == 3 to generate an s\_of\_n.
\item
  call s\_of\_n with each of the digits 0 to 9 in order, keeping the
  returned three digits of its random sampling from its last call with
  argument item=9.
\end{enumerate}

Note: A class taking n and generating a callable instance/function might
also be used.

\section*{Knuth shuffle}

Implement the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth\_shuffle}{Knuth
shuffle} (a.k.a. the Fisher-Yates shuffle) for an integer array (or, if
possible, an array of any type). The Knuth shuffle is used to create a
random permutation of an array.

\begin{wideverbatim}

(de shuffle (Lst)
   (make
      (for (N (length Lst) (gt0 N))
         (setq Lst
            (conc
               (cut (rand 0 (dec 'N)) 'Lst)
               (prog (link (car Lst)) (cdr Lst)) ) ) ) ) )
