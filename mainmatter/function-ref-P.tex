\section*{\texttt{(path 'any) -> sym}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(path 'any) -> sym}


Substitutes any leading ``\texttt{@}'' character in the \texttt{any}
argument with the PicoLisp Home Directory, as it was remembered during
interpreter startup. Optionally, the name may be preceded by a
``\texttt{+}'' character (as used by \texttt{in} and \texttt{out}).
This mechanism is used internally by all I/O functions. See also
\emph{Invocation}, \texttt{basename} and \texttt{dirname}.

\label{sec:func-ref-P-(pick 'fun 'lst ..) -> any}


Applies \texttt{fun} to successive elements of \texttt{lst} until non-\texttt{NIL} is
returned. Returns that value, or \texttt{NIL} if \texttt{fun} did not return non-\texttt{NIL}
for any element of \texttt{lst}. When additional \texttt{lst} arguments are given,
their elements are also passed to \texttt{fun}. \texttt{(pick 'fun 'lst)} is
equivalent to \texttt{(fun (find 'fun 'lst))}. See also \texttt{seek}, \texttt{find} and
\texttt{extract}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (setq A NIL  B 1  C NIL  D 2  E NIL  F 3)

namespace of internal symbols. Its value is a cons pair of two `\texttt{idx}'
trees, one for symbols with short names and one for symbols with long
names (more than 7 bytes in the name). See also \texttt{symbols}, \texttt{import} and
\texttt{intern}.

result set with all Pilog variables bound to their matching values. See
also \texttt{solve}, \texttt{?}, \texttt{goal} and \texttt{prove}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (pilog '((append @X @Y (a b c))) (println @X '- @Y))
NIL - (a b c)

(a b) - (c)
(a b c) - NIL
-> NIL
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(pipe exe) -> cnt}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(pipe exe) -> cnt}


\texttt{(pipe exe . prg) -> any}

Executes \texttt{exe} in a \texttt{fork}'ed child process (which terminates
thereafter). In the first form, \texttt{pipe} just returns a file descriptor to
read from the standard output of that process. In the second form, it
opens the standard output of that process as input channel during the
execution of \texttt{prg}. The current input channel will be saved and restored
appropriately. See also \texttt{later}, \texttt{ipid}, \texttt{in} and \texttt{out}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (pipe                                # equivalent to 'any'
   (prinl "(a b # Comment^Jc d)")         # (child process)
   (read) )                               # (parent process)
-> (a b c d)
: (pipe                                # pipe through an external program
   (out '(tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]")             # (child process)
      (prinl "abc def ghi") )

operation. See also \texttt{insert}, \texttt{remove}, \texttt{append}, \texttt{delete} and
\texttt{replace}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (place 3 '(a b c d e) 777)
-> (a b 777 d e)
: (place 1 '(a b c d e) 777)

\section*{\texttt{(poll 'cnt) -> cnt | NIL}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(poll 'cnt) -> cnt | NIL}


Checks for the availability of data for reading on the file descriptor
\texttt{cnt}. See also \texttt{open}, \texttt{in} and \texttt{close}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (and (poll *Fd) (in @ (read)))  # Prevent blocking
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(pool ['sym1 ['lst] ['sym2] ['sym3]]) -> T}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(pool ['sym1 ['lst] ['sym2] ['sym3]]) -> T}


Opens the file \texttt{sym1} as a database file in read/write mode. If the file
does not exist, it is created. A currently open database is closed.
\texttt{lst} is a list of block size scale factors (i.e. numbers), defaulting
to (2) (for a single file with a 256 byte block size). If \texttt{lst} is
given, an individual database file is opened for each item. If \texttt{sym2} is
non-\texttt{NIL}, it is opened in append-mode as an asynchronous replication
journal. If \texttt{sym3} is non-\texttt{NIL}, it is opened for reading and appending,
to be used as a synchronous transaction log during \texttt{commit}s. See also \texttt{dbs}, \texttt{*Dbs} and \texttt{journal}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (pool "/dev/hda2")
-> T

: *Dbs

\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(port ['T] 'cnt|(cnt . cnt) ['var]) -> cnt}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(port ['T] 'cnt|(cnt . cnt) ['var]) -> cnt}


Opens a TCP-Port \texttt{cnt} (or a UDP-Port if the first argument is \texttt{T}), and
returns a socket descriptor suitable as an argument for \texttt{listen} or
\texttt{accept} (or \texttt{udp}, respectively). If \texttt{cnt} is zero, some free port
number is allocated. If a pair of \texttt{cnt}s is given instead, it should be a range of numbers which are tried in turn. When \texttt{var} is given, it is
bound to the port number.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (port 0 'A)                       # Allocate free port
-> 4
: A
-> 1034                             # Got 1034

greater than 12, it is \texttt{print}ed as is. Otherwise, only the opening
parenthesis and the CAR of the list is printed, all other elementes are
pretty-printed recursively indented by three spaces, followed by a space
and the corresponding closing parenthesis. The initial indentation level
\texttt{cnt} defaults to zero. See also \texttt{pp}.

\label{sec:func-ref-P-(prog1 'any1 . prg) -> any1}


Executes all arguments, and returns the result of the first expression
\texttt{any1}. See also \texttt{nil}, \texttt{t}, \texttt{prog} and \texttt{prog2}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (prog1 (print 1) (print 2) (print 3))
123-> 1
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(prog2 'any1 'any2 . prg) -> any2}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(prog2 'any1 'any2 . prg) -> any2}


Executes all arguments, and returns the result of the second expression
\texttt{any2}. See also \texttt{nil}, \texttt{t}, \texttt{prog} and \texttt{prog1}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (prog2 (print 1) (print 2) (print 3))
123-> 2
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(prop 'sym1|lst ['sym2|cnt ..] 'sym) -> var}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(prop 'sym1|lst ['sym2|cnt ..] 'sym) -> var}


Fetches a property for a property key \texttt{sym} from a symbol. That symbol
is \texttt{sym1} (if no other arguments are given), or a symbol found by
applying the \texttt{get} algorithm to \texttt{sym1|lst} and the following arguments.
The property (the cell, not just its value) is returned, suitable for
direct (destructive) manipulations with functions expecting a \texttt{var}
argument. See also \texttt{::}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (put 'X 'cnt 0)
-> 0
: (prop 'X 'cnt)
-> (0 . cnt)
: (inc (prop 'X 'cnt))        # Directly manipulate the property value
-> 1
: (get 'X 'cnt)
-> 1
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(protect . prg) -> any}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(protect . prg) -> any}


Executes \texttt{prg}, and returns the result of the last expression. If a
signal is received during that time, its handling will be delayed until
the execution of \texttt{prg} is completed. See also \texttt{alarm},
\emph{*Hup}, \emph{*Sig\footnote{DEFINITION NOT FOUND: 12 } and \texttt{kill}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (protect (journal "db1.log" "db2.log"))
-> T
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(prove 'lst ['lst]) -> lst}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(prove 'lst ['lst]) -> lst}


The \emph{Pilog} interpreter. Tries to prove the query list
in the first argument, and returns an association list of symbol-value
pairs, or \texttt{NIL} if not successful. The query list is modified as a side
effect, allowing subsequent calls to \texttt{prove} for further results. The
optional second argument may contain a list of symbols; in that case the
successful matches of rules defined for these symbols will be traced.
See also \texttt{goal}, \texttt{->} and \texttt{unify}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (prove (goal '((equal 3 3))))
-> T
: (prove (goal '((equal 3 @X))))
-> ((@X . 3))
: (prove (goal '((equal 3 4))))
-> NIL
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(prune ['flg])}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(prune ['flg])}


Optimizes memory usage by pruning in-memory leaf nodes of database
trees. Typically called repeatedly during heavy data imports. If \texttt{flg}
is non-\texttt{NIL}, further pruning will be disabled. See also \texttt{lieu}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
(in File1
   (while (someData)
      (new T '(+Cls1) ..)
      (at (0 . 10000) (commit) (prune)) ) )
(in File2
   (while (moreData)
      (new T '(+Cls2) ..)
      (at (0 . 10000) (commit) (prune)) ) )
(commit)
(prune T)
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(push 'var 'any ..) -> any}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(push 'var 'any ..) -> any}


Implements a stack using a list in \texttt{var}. The \texttt{any} arguments are
cons'ed in front of the value list. See also \texttt{push1}, \texttt{pop}, \texttt{queue} and
\texttt{fifo}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (push 'S 3)              # Use the VAL of 'S' as a stack
-> 3
: S
-> (3)
: (push 'S 2)
-> 2
: (push 'S 1)
-> 1
: S
-> (1 2 3)
: (push S 999)             # Now use the CAR of the list in 'S'
-> 999
: (push S 888 777)
-> 777
: S
-> ((777 888 999 . 1) 2 3)
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(push1 'var 'any ..) -> any}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(push1 'var 'any ..) -> any}


Maintains a unique list in \texttt{var}. Each \texttt{any} argument is cons'ed in
front of the value list only if it is not already a \texttt{member} of that
list. See also \texttt{push}, \texttt{pop} and \texttt{queue}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (push1 'S 1 2 3)
-> 3
: S
-> (3 2 1)
: (push1 'S 2 4)
-> 4
: S
-> (4 3 2 1)
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(put 'sym1|lst ['sym2|cnt ..] 'sym|0 'any) -> any}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(put 'sym1|lst ['sym2|cnt ..] 'sym|0 'any) -> any}


Stores a new value \texttt{any} for a property key \texttt{sym} (or in the value cell
for zero) in a symbol. That symbol is \texttt{sym1} (if no other arguments are
given), or a symbol found by applying the \texttt{get} algorithm to \texttt{sym1|lst}
and the following arguments. See also \texttt{=:}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (put 'X 'a 1)
-> 1
: (get 'X 'a)
-> 1
: (prop 'X 'a)
-> (1 . a)

: (setq L '(A B C))
-> (A B C)
: (setq B 'D)
-> D
: (put L 2 0 'p 5)  # Store '5' under the 'p' propery of the value of 'B'
-> 5
: (getl 'D)
-> ((5 . p))
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(put! 'obj 'sym 'any) -> any}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(put! 'obj 'sym 'any) -> any}


\emph{Transaction} wrapper function for \texttt{put}. Note that
for setting property values of entities typically the \texttt{put!>} message is
used. See also \texttt{new!}, \texttt{set!} and \texttt{inc!}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
(put! Obj 'cnt 0)  # Setting a property of a non-entity object
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(putl 'sym1|lst1 ['sym2|cnt ..] 'lst) -> lst}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(putl 'sym1|lst1 ['sym2|cnt ..] 'lst) -> lst}


Stores a complete new property list \texttt{lst} in a symbol. That symbol is
\texttt{sym1} (if no other arguments are given), or a symbol found by applying
the \texttt{get} algorithm to \texttt{sym1|lst1} and the following arguments. All
previously defined properties for that symbol are lost. See also \texttt{getl}
and \texttt{maps}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (putl 'X '((123 . a) flg ("Hello" . b)))
-> ((123 . a) flg ("Hello" . b))
: (get 'X 'a)
-> 123
: (get 'X 'b)
-> "Hello"
: (get 'X 'flg)
-> T
\end{wideverbatim}

 
\section*{\texttt{(pwd) -> sym}}
\label{sec:func-ref-P-(pwd) -> sym}


Returns the path to the current working directory. See also \texttt{dir} and
\texttt{cd}.


\begin{wideverbatim}
: (pwd)
-> "/home/app/"
\end{wideverbatim}
