===================

The source code of the free book **PicoLisp by Example**

*Why PicoLisp?* Short answer: PicoLisp as a language is
maximizing expressive power while minimizing complexity

**PicoLisp** is a very simple and succinct, yet expressive language -
and it is free (MIT/X11 License). Furthermore, PicoLisp has two
characteristic features which are not found to that extent in other
languages:

*  An integrated database
*  Equivalence of code and data

These two features alone, and how they are used in combination, make
it worth to take a closer look at PicoLisp.

The book *PicoLisp by Example* has three parts:

1. 99 Lisp Problems (with PicoLisp solutions for more than half of them)
2. Rosetta Code Tasks (more than 600 PicoLisp solutions)
3. PicoLisp Function Reference (with a complete descriptions of all symbols that constitute the language core)

It is an accompaniment of another volume, **PicoLisp Works**,
(https://github.com/tj64/picolisp-works) with (almost) all docs ever
written about PicoLisp. Both volumes are freely available as *pdf*
files, e.g. on [Scribd] (http://scribd.com).

This book is published under the *GNU Free Documentation Licence*.
